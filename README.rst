Highlights
==========

- Re-use the same socket connection for multiple requests
  (``HTTPConnectionPool`` and ``HTTPSConnectionPool``)
  (with optional client-side certificate verification).
- File posting (``encode_multipart_formdata``).
- Built-in redirection and retries (optional).
- Supports gzip and deflate decoding.
- Proxy over HTTP or SOCKS.
- Thread-safe and sanity-safe.
- Works with AppEngine, gevent, and eventlib.
- Tested on Python 2.6+, Python 3.3+, and PyPy, with 100% unit test coverage.
- Small and easy to understand codebase perfect for extending and building upon.
  For a more comprehensive solution, have a look at
  `Requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_ which is also powered by ``urllib3``.


You might already be using urllib3!
===================================

``urllib3`` powers `many great Python libraries
<https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=package+urllib3>`_, including ``pip`` and
``requests``.


What's wrong with urllib and urllib2?
=====================================

There are two critical features missing from the Python standard library:
Connection re-using/pooling and file posting. It's not terribly hard to
implement these yourself, but it's much easier to use a module that already
did the work for you.

The Python standard libraries ``urllib`` and ``urllib2`` have little to do
with each other. They were designed to be independent and standalone, each
solving a different scope of problems, and ``urllib3`` follows in a similar
vein.


Why do I want to reuse connections?
===================================

Performance. When you normally do a urllib call, a separate socket
connection is created with each request. By reusing existing sockets
(supported since HTTP 1.1), the requests will take up less resources on the
server's end, and also provide a faster response time at the client's end.
With some simple benchmarks (see `test/benchmark.py
<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/blob/master/test/benchmark.py>`_
), downloading 15 URLs from google.com is about twice as fast when using
HTTPConnectionPool (which uses 1 connection) than using plain urllib (which
uses 15 connections).

This library is perfect for:

- Talking to an API
- Crawling a website
- Any situation where being able to post files, handle redirection, and
  retrying is useful. It's relatively lightweight, so it can be used for
  anything!


How do I use urllib3 in a multi-process environment?
===================================

urllib3 is not currently multiprocess-safe.

One thing to note is that: Reusing connections is good. However, 
resources (i.e. sockets) cannot be shared between processes, and 
behaviour of pre-used pools after forking to a new process is undefined.
For example, a socket remaining in the pool before forking could after be 
used by multiple process at the same time.

So make sure to fork first before actually using your urllib3 pools.
Otherwise, it is users' responsiblity to clean up at fork to make sure 
things are correct.


Examples
========

Go to `urllib3.readthedocs.org <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io>`_
for more nice syntax-highlighted examples.

But, long story short::

  import urllib3

  http = urllib3.PoolManager()

  r = http.request('GET', 'http://google.com/')

  print r.status, r.data

The ``PoolManager`` will take care of reusing connections for you whenever
you request the same host. For more fine-grained control of your connection
pools, you should look at `ConnectionPool
<https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/#connectionpool>`_.


Run the tests
=============

We use some external dependencies, multiple interpreters and code coverage
analysis while running test suite. Our ``Makefile`` handles much of this for
you as long as you're running it `inside of a virtualenv
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_::

  $ make test
  [... magically installs dependencies and runs tests on your virtualenv]
  Ran 182 tests in 1.633s

  OK (SKIP=6)

Note that code coverage less than 100% is regarded as a failing run. Some
platform-specific tests are skipped unless run in that platform.  To make sure
the code works in all of urllib3's supported platforms, you can run our ``tox``
suite::

  $ make test-all
  [... tox creates a virtualenv for every platform and runs tests inside of each]
  py26: commands succeeded
  py27: commands succeeded
  py32: commands succeeded
  py33: commands succeeded
  py34: commands succeeded

Our test suite `runs continuously on Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/shazow/urllib3>`_ with every pull request.
