Removed support for OpenSSL versions earlier than 1.1.1 or that don't have SNI support.
When an incompatible OpenSSL version is detected an ``ImportError`` is raised.

Removed support for Python with an ``ssl`` module compiled with LibreSSL, CiscoSSL,
wolfSSL, and all other OpenSSL alternatives. Python is moving to require OpenSSL with PEP 644.

Changed ``urllib3.util.create_urllib3_context`` to not override the system cipher suites with
a default value. The new default will be cipher suites configured by the operating system.

Removed ``DEFAULT_CIPHERS``, ``HAS_SNI``, ``USE_DEFAULT_SSLCONTEXT_CIPHERS``, from the private module ``urllib3.util.ssl_``.

Removed ``urllib3.exceptions.SNIMissingWarning``.
