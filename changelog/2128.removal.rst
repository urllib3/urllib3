Standardized :meth:`~urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.read` to respect the semantics of BufferedIOBase regardless of compression. Specifically, this method:

* only returns an empty bytes object to indicate EOF (that is, the response has been fully consumed),
* never returns more bytes than requested,
* can issue any number of system calls: zero, one or multiple.

If you want each :meth:`~urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.read` call to issue a single system call, you need to disable decompression by setting ``decode_content=False``.
