Added experimental support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 independently of httplib.

Currently urllib3 does not offer async http request and the backend is the http.client package
shipped alongside Python. This implementation is not scheduled to improve, even less to support latest
protocol.

Without proxies, the negotiation is as follow:

- http requests are always made using HTTP/1.1.
- https requests are made with HTTP/2 if TLS-ALPN yield its support otherwise HTTP/1.1.

- https requests may upgrade to HTTP/3 if latest response contain a valid Alt-Svc header.

With proxies:

- The initial proxy request is always issued using HTTP/1.1 regardless if its http or https.
- Subsequents requests follow the previous section (Without proxies) at the sole exception that HTTP/3 upgrade is disabled.

You may explicitly disable HTTP/2 or, and, HTTP/3 by passing ``disabled_svn={HttpVersion.h2}`` to your ``BaseHttpConnection`` instance.
Disabling HTTP/1.1 is forbidden and raise an error.

Note that a valid or accepted Alt-Svc header in urllib3 means looking for the "h3" (final specification) protocol and disallow switching hostname for security
reasons.

Starting now, users may start to experiment detaching themselves from it by installing urllib
as follow ``pip install urllib3[h2n3]``.
