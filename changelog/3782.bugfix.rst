Fixed ``_ssl_wrap_socket_and_match_hostname`` overriding ``verify_mode`` on factory-created SSL contexts. Previously, ``cert_reqs`` was applied by the factory and then unconditionally re-applied at the call site, silently undoing any customization the factory made (such as application-level patches via ``sitecustomize.py``). The override now only applies to caller-supplied contexts.
