The ``proxy_ssl_context`` argument for ``urllib3.ProxyManager`` will be used
for the connection to the proxy when the connection is forwarded, either because
``use_forwarding_for_https`` is set to ``True`` or because the target is a HTTP destination.
Previously, ``proxy_ssl_context`` was not used in these situations. If ``ssl_context``
is passed as a keyword argument, it will be used if ``proxy_ssl_context`` is not set,
but this use is deprecated.
