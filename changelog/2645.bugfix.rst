Fixed an issue where an ``HTTPConnection`` instance would erroneously reuse the socket
read timeout value from reading the previous response instead of a newly configured connect timeout.
Instead now if ``HTTPConnection.timeout`` is updated before sending the next request the new timeout value will be used.
