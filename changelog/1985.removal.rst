Added the ``scheme`` parameter to ``HTTPConnection.set_tunnel`` to configure the scheme of the origin being tunnelled to.

Added the ``is_closed``, ``is_connected`` and ``has_connected_to_proxy`` properties to ``HTTPConnection``.

Changed all parameters in the ``HTTPConnection`` and ``HTTPSConnection`` constructors to be keyword-only except ``host`` and ``port``.

Changed ``urllib3.util.is_connection_dropped()`` to use ``HTTPConnection.is_connected``.

Removed the ``_proxy_host`` property from ``HTTPConnectionPool`` which was only used in one place. The ``host`` property (which is identical in value) is used instead.

Removed the ``_prepare_conn`` method from ``HTTPConnectionPool``.

Removed ``tls_in_tls_required`` property from `HTTPSConnection`. This is now calculated from the ``scheme`` parameter in ``HTTPConnection.set_tunnel()``.

Deprecated ``HTTPSConnection.set_cert`` method, instead pass parameters to the ``HTTPSConnection`` constructor.
