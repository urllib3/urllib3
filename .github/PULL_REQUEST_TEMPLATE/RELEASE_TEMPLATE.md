> ### Before creating a release PR
> * [ ]  Announce intent to release on Discord, see if anyone wants to include last minute changes
> * [ ]  Create a `release-X.Y.Z` branch that bumps the version number and updates the changelog
> * [ ]  Create a pull request, see if all tests, including integration, pass
