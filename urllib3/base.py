This module provides the base structure of the Request/Response objects that
urllib3 passes around to manage its HTTP semantic layer.

These objects are the lowest common denominator: that is, they define the
Request/Response functionality that is always supported by urllib3. This means
they do not include any extra function required for asynchrony: that
functionality is handled elsewhere. Any part of urllib3 is required to be able
to work with one of these objects.

    changing them as necessary. The low-level layers know how to send these

        Add the Host header, as needed.

        This helper method exists to circumvent an ordering problem: the best
        layer to add the Host header is the bottom layer, but it is the layer
        that will add headers last. That means that they will appear at the
        bottom of the header block.

        Proxies, caches, and other intermediaries *hate* it when clients do
        that because the Host header is routing information, and they'd like to
        see it as early as possible. For this reason, this method ensures that
        the Host header will be the first one emitted. It also ensures that we
        do not duplicate the host header: if there already is one, we just use
        that one.
