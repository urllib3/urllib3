Highlights
==========

- Re-use the same socket connection for multiple requests, with optional
  client-side certificate verification. See:
  :class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool` and
  :class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPSConnectionPool`

- File posting. See:
  :func:`~urllib3.filepost.encode_multipart_formdata`

- Built-in redirection and retries (optional).

- Supports gzip and deflate decoding. See:
  :func:`~urllib3.response.decode_gzip` and
  :func:`~urllib3.response.decode_deflate`

- Thread-safe and sanity-safe.

- Tested on Python 2.6+ and Python 3.2+, 100% unit test coverage.

- Works with AppEngine, gevent, and eventlib.

- Small and easy to understand codebase perfect for extending and building upon.
  For a more comprehensive solution, have a look at
  `Requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_ which is also powered by urllib3.


Getting Started
===============

Installing
----------

``pip install urllib3`` or fetch the latest source from
`github.com/shazow/urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_.

Usage
-----

::

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager()
    >>> r = http.request('GET', 'http://google.com/')
    >>> r.status
    200
    >>> r.headers['server']
    'gws'
    >>> r.data
    ...

Components
==========

:mod:`urllib3` tries to strike a fine balance between power, extendability, and
sanity. To achieve this, the codebase is a collection of small reusable
utilities and abstractions composed together in a few helpful layers.

PoolManager
-----------

The highest level is the :doc:`PoolManager(...) <managers>`.

The :class:`~urllib3.poolmanagers.PoolManager` will take care of reusing
connections for you whenever you request the same host. This should cover most
scenarios without significant loss of efficiency, but you can always drop down
to a lower level component for more granular control.

::

    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager(10)
    >>> r1 = http.request('GET', 'http://google.com/')
    >>> r2 = http.request('GET', 'http://google.com/mail')
    >>> r3 = http.request('GET', 'http://yahoo.com/')
    >>> len(http.pools)
    2

A :class:`~urllib3.poolmanagers.PoolManager` is a proxy for a collection of
:class:`ConnectionPool` objects. They both inherit from
:class:`~urllib3.request.RequestMethods` to make sure that their API is
similar, so that instances of either can be passed around interchangeably.

ProxyManager
------------

The :class:`~urllib3.poolmanagers.ProxyManager` is an HTTP proxy-aware
subclass of :class:`~urllib3.poolmanagers.PoolManager`. It produces a single
:class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool` instance for all HTTP
connections and individual per-server:port
:class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPSConnectionPool` instances for tunnelled
HTTPS connections:

::

    >>> proxy = urllib3.ProxyManager('http://localhost:3128/')
    >>> r1 = proxy.request('GET', 'http://google.com/')
    >>> r2 = proxy.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/')
    >>> len(proxy.pools)
    1
    >>> r3 = proxy.request('GET', 'https://httpbin.org/')
    >>> r4 = proxy.request('GET', 'https://twitter.com/')
    >>> len(proxy.pools)
    3

ConnectionPool
--------------

The next layer is the :doc:`ConnectionPool(...) <pools>`.

The :class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool` and
:class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPSConnectionPool` classes allow you to
define a pool of connections to a single host and make requests against this
pool with automatic **connection reusing** and **thread safety**.

When the :mod:`ssl` module is available, then
:class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPSConnectionPool` objects can be configured
to check SSL certificates against specific provided certificate authorities. ::

    >>> conn = urllib3.connection_from_url('http://www.google.com')
    >>> r1 = conn.request('GET', 'http://www.google.com/')
    >>> r2 = conn.request('GET', '/search')
    >>> r3 = conn.request('GET', 'http://wwww.yahoo.com/')
    Traceback (most recent call last)
      ...
    HostChangedError: Connection pool with host 'http://google.com' tried to
    open a foreign host: http://yahoo.com/

Again, a ConnectionPool is a pool of connections to a specific host. Trying to
access a different host through the same pool will raise a ``HostChangedError``
exception unless you specify ``assert_same_host=False``. Do this at your own
risk as the outcome is completely dependent on the behaviour of the host server.

If you need to access multiple hosts and don't want to manage your own
collection of :class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.ConnectionPool` objects, then you
should use a :class:`~urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager`.

A :class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.ConnectionPool` is composed of a collection
of :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection` objects.

Timeout
-------

A timeout can be set to abort socket operations on individual connections after 
a specified duration. This can be done with a float or integer, which sets the 
timeout for the entire HTTP request, or an instance of :class:`~urllib3.util.Timeout` 
which will give you more granular control over how much time is given to different 
stages of the request. 

::

    >>> # Timeout on pool with 7.0 for both connect and read.
    >>> pool = HTTPConnectionPool('ajax.googleapis.com', timeout=7.0) 
    >>> pool.request(...) 

    >>> # Timeout object on pool with infinite timeout for connections and 5 for read.
    >>> pool = HTTPConnectionPool('ajax.googleapis.com', timeout=urllib3.util.Timeout(read=5)) 
    >>> pool.request(...) 

    >>> # Timeout object on request with 3 for connect and 5 for read.
    >>> pool = HTTPConnectionPool('ajax.googleapis.com', maxsize=1)
    >>> r = pool.request('GET', '/ajax/services/search/web', timeout=urllib3.util.Timeout(connect=3, read=5))

    >>> # Timeout object on request with 7.5 for read and connect combined.
    >>> pool = HTTPConnectionPool('ajax.googleapis.com', maxsize=1)
    >>> r = pool.request('GET', '/ajax/services/search/web', timeout=urllib3.util.Timeout(total=7.5))

Foundation
----------

At the very core, just like its predecessors, :mod:`urllib3` is built on top of
:mod:`httplib` -- the lowest level HTTP library included in the Python
standard library.

To aid the limited functionality of the :mod:`httplib` module, :mod:`urllib3`
provides various helper methods which are used with the higher level components
but can also be used independently.

Contrib Modules
---------------

These modules implement various extra features, that may not be ready for
prime time.

Notes
=====

- SSL/TLS compression is disabled by default on Python 3.2+ to migitate the
  `CRIME attack`_. You can disable compression on Python 2 by using the
  :ref:`pyopenssl contrib module <pyopenssl>`, although this requires additional
  dependencies and might have undesired side effects due to the nature of
  PyOpenSSL.
