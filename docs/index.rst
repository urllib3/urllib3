urllib3 is a powerful, *sanity-friendly* HTTP client for Python. Much of the
Python ecosystem :ref:`already uses <who-uses>` urllib3 and you should too.
urllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python
standard libraries:

- Thread safety.
- Connection pooling.
- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
- File uploads with multipart encoding.
- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
- Support for gzip and deflate encoding.
- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
- 100% test coverage.

urllib3 is powerful and easy to use::

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager()
    >>> r = http.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')
    >>> r.status
    200
    >>> r.data
    'User-agent: *\nDisallow: /deny\n'
