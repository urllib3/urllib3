Contributing
============

urllib3 is a community-maintained project and we happily accept contributions.

If you wish to add a new feature or fix a bug:

#. `Check for open issues <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues>`_ or open
   a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug. There is
   a *Contributor Friendly* tag for issues that should be ideal for people who
   are not very familiar with the codebase yet.
#. Fork the `urllib3 repository on Github <https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3>`_
   to start making your changes.
#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works
   as expected.
#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.
   :) Make sure to add yourself to ``CONTRIBUTORS.txt``.


Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

It is recommended, and even enforced by the make file, that you use a 
`virtualenv
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_::

  $ python3 -m venv venv3
  $ source venv3/bin/activate
  $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


Running the tests
-----------------

We use some external dependencies, multiple interpreters and code coverage
analysis while running test suite. Our ``Makefile`` handles much of this for
you as long as you're running it `inside of a virtualenv
<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_::

  $ make test-quick
  [... magically installs dependencies and runs tests on your virtualenv]
  Ran 182 tests in 1.633s

  OK (SKIP=6)

There is also a make target for running all of our tests and multiple python
versions.

  $ make test-all

Note that code coverage less than 100% is regarded as a failing run. Some
platform-specific tests are skipped unless run in that platform.  To make sure
the code works in all of urllib3's supported platforms, you can run our ``tox``
suite::

  $ make test-all
  [... tox creates a virtualenv for every platform and runs tests inside of each]
  py27: commands succeeded
  py34: commands succeeded
  py35: commands succeeded
  py36: commands succeeded
  py37: commands succeeded
  pypy: commands succeeded

Our test suite `runs continuously on Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/urllib3/urllib3>`_ with every pull request.

Releases
--------

A release candidate can be created by any contributor by creating a branch
named ``release-x.x`` where ``x.x`` is the version of the proposed release.

- Update ``CHANGES.rst`` and ``urllib3/__init__.py`` with the proper version number
  and commit the changes to ``release-x.x``.
- Open a pull request to merge the ``release-x.x`` branch into the ``master`` branch.
- Integration tests are run against the release candidate on Travis. From here on all
  the steps below will be handled by a maintainer so unless you receive review comments
  you are done here.
- Once the pull request is squash merged into master the merging maintainer the
  pull request will tag the merge commit with the version number:

  - ``git tag -a 1.24.1 [commit sha]``
  - ``git push origin master --tags``

- After the commit is tagged Travis will build the tagged commit and upload the sdist and wheel
  to PyPI and create a draft release on GitHub for the tag. The merging maintainer will
  ensure that the PyPI sdist and wheel are properly uploaded.
- The merging maintainer will mark the draft release on GitHub as an approved release.

Please consider sponsoring urllib3 development, especially if your company
benefits from this library.

Your contribution will go towards adding new features to urllib3 and making
sure all functionality continues to meet our high quality standards.

We also welcome sponsorship in the form of time. We greatly appreciate companies
who encourage employees to contribute on an ongoing basis during their work hours.
Please let us know and we'll be glad to add you to our sponsors list!

A grant for contiguous full-time development has the biggest impact for
progress. Periods of 3 to 10 days allow a contributor to tackle substantial
complex issues which are otherwise left to linger until somebody can't afford
to not fix them.

Contact `@theacodes <https://github.com/theacodes>`_ or `@shazow <https://github.com/shazow>`_ 
to arrange a grant for a core contributor.

Huge thanks to all the companies and individuals who financially contributed to
the development of urllib3. Please send a PR if you've donated and would like
to be listed.
