Security: Verified HTTPS with SSL/TLS
=====================================

Very important fact: **By default, urllib4 does not verify HTTPS requests.**

The historic reason for this is that we rely on ``httplib`` for some of the
HTTP protocol implementation, and ``httplib`` does not verify requests out of
the box. This is not a good reason, but here we are.

Luckily, it's not too hard to enable verified HTTPS requests and there are a
few ways to do it.


Python with SSL enabled
-----------------------

First we need to make sure your Python installation has SSL enabled. Easiest
way to check is to simply open a Python shell and type `import ssl`::

    >>> import ssl
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ImportError: No module named _ssl

If you got an ``ImportError``, then your Python is not compiled with SSL support
and you'll need to re-install it. Read
`this StackOverflow thread <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5128845/importerror-no-module-named-ssl>`_
for details.

Otherwise, if ``ssl`` imported cleanly, then we're ready to setup our certificates:
:ref:`certifi-with-urllib4`.


Enabling SSL on Google AppEngine
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you're using Google App Engine, you'll need to add ``ssl`` as a library
dependency to your yaml file, like this::

    libraries:
    - name: ssl
      version: latest

If it's still not working, you may need to enable billing on your account
to `enable using sockets
<https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/>`_.


.. _certifi-with-urllib4:

Using Certifi with urllib4
--------------------------

`Certifi <http://certifi.io/>`_ is a package which ships with Mozilla's root
certificates for easy programmatic access.

1. Install the Python ``certifi`` package::

    $ pip install certifi

2. Setup your pool to require a certificate and provide the certifi bundle::

    import urllib4
    import certifi

    http = urllib4.PoolManager(
        cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED', # Force certificate check.
        ca_certs=certifi.where(),  # Path to the Certifi bundle.
    )

    # You're ready to make verified HTTPS requests.
    try:
        r = http.request('GET', 'https://example.com/')
    except urllib4.exceptions.SSLError as e:
        # Handle incorrect certificate error.
        ...

Make sure to update your ``certifi`` package regularly to get the latest root
certificates.


Using your system's root certificates
-------------------------------------

Your system's root certificates may be more up-to-date than maintaining your
own, but the trick is finding where they live. Different operating systems have
them in different places.

For example, on most Linux distributions they're at
``/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt``. On Windows and OS X? `It's not so simple
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10095676/openssl-reasonable-default-for-trusted-ca-certificates>`_.

Once you find your root certificate file::

    import urllib4

    ca_certs = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"  # Or wherever it lives.

    http = urllib4.PoolManager(
        cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED', # Force certificate check.
        ca_certs=ca_certs,         # Path to your certificate bundle.
    )

    # You're ready to make verified HTTPS requests.
    try:
        r = http.request('GET', 'https://example.com/')
    except urllib4.exceptions.SSLError as e:
        # Handle incorrect certificate error.
        ...


.. _pyopenssl:

OpenSSL / PyOpenSSL
-------------------

By default, we use the standard library's ``ssl`` module. Unfortunately, there
are several limitations which are addressed by PyOpenSSL:

- (Python 2.x) SNI support.
- (Python 2.x-3.2) Disabling compression to mitigate `CRIME attack
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)>`_.

To use the Python OpenSSL bindings instead, you'll need to install the required
packages::

    $ pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1

Once the packages are installed, you can tell urllib4 to switch the ssl backend
to PyOpenSSL with :func:`~urllib4.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib4`::

    import urllib4.contrib.pyopenssl
    urllib4.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib4()

Now you can continue using urllib4 as you normally would.

For more details, check the :mod:`~urllib4.contrib.pyopenssl` module.


.. _insecurerequestwarning:

InsecureRequestWarning
----------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.9

Unverified HTTPS requests will trigger a warning via Python's ``warnings`` module::

    urllib4/connectionpool.py:736: InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS
    request is being made. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised.
    See: https://urllib4.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html

This would be a great time to enable HTTPS verification:
:ref:`certifi-with-urllib4`.

If you know what you're doing and would like to disable this and other warnings,
you can use :func:`~urllib4.disable_warnings`::

    import urllib4
    urllib4.disable_warnings()

Making unverified HTTPS requests is strongly discouraged. ˙ ͜ʟ˙

Alternatively, if you are using Python's ``logging`` module, you can capture the
warnings to your own log::

	logging.captureWarnings(True)

Capturing the warnings to your own log is much preferred over simply disabling
the warnings.

InsecurePlatformWarning
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.11

Certain Python platforms (specifically, versions of Python earlier than 2.7.9)
have restrictions in their ``ssl`` module that limit the configuration that
``urllib4`` can apply. In particular, this can cause HTTPS requests that would
succeed on more featureful platforms to fail, and can cause certain security
features to be unavailable.

If you encounter this warning, it is strongly recommended you upgrade to a
newer Python version, or that you use pyOpenSSL as described in the
:ref:`pyopenssl` section.

If you know what you are doing and would like to disable this and other
warnings, please consult the :ref:`insecurerequestwarning` section for
instructions on how to handle the warnings.
