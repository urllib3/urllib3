Grants
------

Please consider sponsoring urllib3 development, especially if your company
benefits from this library.

Your contribution will go towards adding new features to urllib3 and making
sure all functionality continues to meet our high quality standards.

We also welcome sponsorship in the form of time. We greatly appreciate companies
who encourage employees to contribute on an ongoing basis during their work hours.
Please let us know and we'll be glad to add you to our sponsors list!

A grant for contiguous full-time development has the biggest impact for
progress. Periods of 3 to 10 days allow a contributor to tackle substantial
complex issues which are otherwise left to linger until somebody can't afford
to not fix them.

Contact `@sethmlarson <https://github.com/sethmlarson>`_ or `@shazow <https://github.com/shazow>`_
to arrange a grant for a core contributor.

Huge thanks to all the companies and individuals who financially contributed to
the development of urllib3. Please send a PR if you've donated and would like
to be listed.
