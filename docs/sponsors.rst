Sponsors and Grants
-------------------

A grant for contiguous full-time development has the biggest impact for
progress. Periods of 3 to 10 days allow a contributor to tackle substantial
complex issues which are otherwise left to linger until somebody can't afford
to not fix them.

Contact `@sethmlarson <https://github.com/sethmlarson>`_ or `@shazow <https://github.com/shazow>`_
to arrange a grant for a core contributor.

We also welcome sponsorship in the form of time. We greatly appreciate companies
who encourage employees to contribute on an ongoing basis during their work hours.
Let us know and we'll be glad to add you to our sponsors list.
