Sponsors and Supporters
=======================

Please consider sponsoring urllib3 development, especially if your company
benefits from this library.

Your contribution will go towards adding new features to urllib3 and making
sure all functionality continues to meet our high quality standards.

All expenses and contributions can be `tracked on our Open Collective page
<https://opencollective.com/urllib3>`__. We also write annual reports:

Sponsors and Grants (prior to 2019)
-----------------------------------

A grant for contiguous full-time development has the biggest impact for
progress. Periods of 3 to 10 days allow a contributor to tackle substantial
complex issues which are otherwise left to linger until somebody can't afford
to not fix them.

Contact `@sethmlarson <https://github.com/sethmlarson>`_ or `@shazow <https://github.com/shazow>`_
to arrange a grant for a core contributor.

We also welcome sponsorship in the form of time. We greatly appreciate companies
who encourage employees to contribute on an ongoing basis during their work hours.
Let us know and we'll be glad to add you to our sponsors list.
