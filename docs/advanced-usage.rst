.. currentmodule:: urllib3


Customizing Pool Behavior
-------------------------

The :class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager` class automatically handles creating
:class:`~connectionpool.ConnectionPool` instances for each host as needed. By
default, it will keep a maximum of 10 :class:`~connectionpool.ConnectionPool`
instances. If you're making requests to many different hosts it might improve
performance to increase this number.

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(num_pools=50)

However, keep in mind that this does increase memory and socket consumption.

Similarly, the :class:`~connectionpool.ConnectionPool` class keeps a pool
of individual :class:`~connection.HTTPConnection` instances. These connections
are used during an individual request and returned to the pool when the request
is complete. By default only one connection will be saved for re-use. If you
are making many requests to the same host simultaneously it might improve
performance to increase this number.

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(maxsize=10)
    # Alternatively
    pool = urllib3.HTTPConnectionPool("google.com", maxsize=10)

The behavior of the pooling for :class:`~connectionpool.ConnectionPool` is
different from :class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager`. By default, if a new
request is made and there is no free connection in the pool then a new
connection will be created. However, this connection will not be saved if more
than ``maxsize`` connections exist. This means that ``maxsize`` does not
determine the maximum number of connections that can be open to a particular
host, just the maximum number of connections to keep in the pool. However, if you specify ``block=True`` then there can be at most ``maxsize`` connections
open to a particular host.

.. code-block:: python

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(maxsize=10, block=True)

    # Alternatively
    pool = urllib3.HTTPConnectionPool("google.com", maxsize=10, block=True)

Any new requests will block until a connection is available from the pool.
This is a great way to prevent flooding a host with too many connections in
multi-threaded applications.

.. _stream:
.. _streaming_and_io:

Streaming and I/O
-----------------

When using ``preload_content=True`` (the default setting) the
response body will be read immediately into memory and the HTTP connection
will be released back into the pool without manual intervention.

However, when dealing with large responses it's often better to stream the response
content using ``preload_content=False``. Setting ``preload_content`` to ``False`` means
that urllib3 will only read from the socket when data is requested.

.. note:: When using ``preload_content=False``, you need to manually release
    the HTTP connection back to the connection pool so that it can be re-used.
    To ensure the HTTP connection is in a valid state before being re-used
    all data should be read off the wire.

    You can call the  :meth:`~response.HTTPResponse.drain_conn` to throw away
    unread data still on the wire. This call isn't necessary if data has already
    been completely read from the response.

    After all data is read you can call :meth:`~response.HTTPResponse.release_conn`
    to release the connection into the pool.

    You can call the :meth:`~response.HTTPResponse.close` to close the connection,
    but this call doesnâ€™t return the connection to the pool, throws away the unread
    data on the wire, and leaves the connection in an undefined protocol state.
    This is desirable if you prefer not reading data from the socket to re-using the
    HTTP connection.

:meth:`~response.HTTPResponse.stream` lets you iterate over chunks of the response content.

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    resp = urllib3.request(
        "GET",
        "https://httpbin.org/bytes/1024",
        preload_content=False
    )

    for chunk in resp.stream(32):
        print(chunk)
        # b"\x9e\xa97'\x8e\x1eT ....

    resp.release_conn()

However, you can also treat the :class:`~response.HTTPResponse` instance as
a file-like object. This allows you to do buffering:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    resp = urllib3.request(
        "GET",
        "https://httpbin.org/bytes/1024",
        preload_content=False
    )

    print(resp.read(4))
    # b"\x88\x1f\x8b\xe5"

Calls to :meth:`~response.HTTPResponse.read()` will block until more response
data is available.

.. code-block:: python

    import io
    import urllib3

    resp = urllib3.request(
        "GET",
        "https://httpbin.org/bytes/1024",
        preload_content=False
    )

    reader = io.BufferedReader(resp, 8)
    print(reader.read(4))
    # b"\xbf\x9c\xd6"

    resp.release_conn()

You can use this file-like object to do things like decode the content using
:mod:`codecs`:

.. code-block:: python

    import codecs
    import json
    import urllib3

    reader = codecs.getreader("utf-8")

    resp = urllib3.request(
        "GET",
        "https://httpbin.org/ip",
        preload_content=False
    )

    print(json.load(reader(resp)))
    # {"origin": "127.0.0.1"}

    resp.release_conn()

.. _proxies:

Proxies
-------

You can use :class:`~poolmanager.ProxyManager` to tunnel requests through an
HTTP proxy:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    proxy = urllib3.ProxyManager("https://localhost:3128/")
    proxy.request("GET", "https://google.com/")

The usage of :class:`~poolmanager.ProxyManager` is the same as
:class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager`.

You can connect to a proxy using HTTP, HTTPS or SOCKS. urllib3's behavior will
be different depending on the type of proxy you selected and the destination
you're contacting.

HTTP and HTTPS Proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both HTTP/HTTPS proxies support HTTP and HTTPS destinations. The only
difference between them is if you need to establish a TLS connection to the
proxy first. You can specify which proxy you need to contact by specifying the
proper proxy scheme. (i.e ``http://`` or ``https://``)

urllib3's behavior will be different depending on your proxy and destination:

* HTTP proxy + HTTP destination
   Your request will be forwarded with the `absolute URI
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-absolute-form>`_.

* HTTP proxy + HTTPS destination
    A TCP tunnel will be established with a `HTTP
    CONNECT <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-connect>`_. Afterward a
    TLS connection will be established with the destination and your request
    will be sent.

* HTTPS proxy + HTTP destination
    A TLS connection will be established to the proxy and later your request
    will be forwarded with the `absolute URI
    <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-absolute-form>`_.

* HTTPS proxy + HTTPS destination
    A TLS-in-TLS tunnel will be established.  An initial TLS connection will be
    established to the proxy, then an `HTTP CONNECT
    <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-connect>`_ will be sent to
    establish a TCP connection to the destination and finally a second TLS
    connection will be established to the destination. You can customize the
    :class:`ssl.SSLContext` used for the proxy TLS connection through the
    ``proxy_ssl_context`` argument of the :class:`~poolmanager.ProxyManager`
    class.

For HTTPS proxies we also support forwarding your requests to HTTPS destinations with
an `absolute URI <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-absolute-form>`_ if the
``use_forwarding_for_https`` argument is set to ``True``. We strongly recommend you
**only use this option with trusted or corporate proxies** as the proxy will have
full visibility of your requests.

.. _https_proxy_error_http_proxy:

Your proxy appears to only use HTTP and not HTTPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're receiving the :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.ProxyError` and it mentions
your proxy only speaks HTTP and not HTTPS here's what to do to solve your issue:

If you're using ``urllib3`` directly, make sure the URL you're passing into :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`
starts with ``http://`` instead of ``https://``:

.. code-block:: python

     # Do this:
     http = urllib3.ProxyManager("http://...")
     
     # Not this:
     http = urllib3.ProxyManager("https://...")

If instead you're using ``urllib3`` through another library like Requests
there are multiple ways your proxy could be mis-configured. You need to figure out
where the configuration isn't correct and make the fix there. Some common places
to look are environment variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``, ``HTTPS_PROXY``, and ``ALL_PROXY``.

Ensure that the values for all of these environment variables starts with ``http://``
and not ``https://``:

.. code-block:: bash

     # Check your existing environment variables in bash
     $ env | grep "_PROXY"
     HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888
     HTTPS_PROXY=https://127.0.0.1:8888  # <--- This setting is the problem!
     
     # Make the fix in your current session and test your script
     $ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:8888"
     $ python test-proxy.py  # This should now pass.
     
     # Persist your change in your shell 'profile' (~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile, etc)
     # You may need to logout and log back in to ensure this works across all programs.
     $ vim ~/.bashrc

If you're on Windows or macOS your proxy may be getting set at a system level.
To check this first ensure that the above environment variables aren't set
then run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -c 'import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.getproxies())'

If the output of the above command isn't empty and looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    {
      "http": "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
      "https": "https://127.0.0.1:8888"  # <--- This setting is the problem!
    }

Search how to configure proxies on your operating system and change the ``https://...`` URL into ``http://``.
After you make the change the return value of ``urllib.request.getproxies()`` should be:

.. code-block:: python

    {  # Everything is good here! :)
      "http": "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
      "https": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
    }

If you still can't figure out how to configure your proxy after all these steps

SOCKS Proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


For SOCKS, you can use :class:`~contrib.socks.SOCKSProxyManager` to connect to
SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 proxies. In order to use SOCKS proxies you will need to
install `PySocks <https://pypi.org/project/PySocks/>`_ or install urllib3 with
the ``socks`` extra:

.. code-block:: bash

     python -m pip install urllib3[socks]

Once PySocks is installed, you can use
:class:`~contrib.socks.SOCKSProxyManager`:

.. code-block:: python

    from urllib3.contrib.socks import SOCKSProxyManager

    proxy = SOCKSProxyManager("socks5h://localhost:8889/")
    proxy.request("GET", "https://google.com/")

.. note::
      It is recommended to use ``socks5h://`` or ``socks4a://`` schemes in
      your ``proxy_url`` to ensure that DNS resolution is done from the remote
      server instead of client-side when connecting to a domain name.

.. _ssl_custom:
.. _custom_ssl_certificates:

Custom TLS Certificates
-----------------------

Instead of using `certifi <https://certifi.io/>`_ you can provide your
own certificate authority bundle. This is useful for cases where you've
generated your own certificates or when you're using a private certificate
authority. Just provide the full path to the certificate bundle when creating a
:class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager`:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(
        cert_reqs="CERT_REQUIRED",
        ca_certs="/path/to/your/certificate_bundle"
    )
    resp = http.request("GET", "https://example.com")

When you specify your own certificate bundle only requests that can be
verified with that bundle will succeed. It's recommended to use a separate
:class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager` to make requests to URLs that do not need
the custom certificate.

.. _sni_custom:

Custom SNI Hostname
-------------------

If you want to create a connection to a host over HTTPS which uses SNI, there
are two places where the hostname is expected. It must be included in the Host
header sent, so that the server will know which host is being requested. The
hostname should also match the certificate served by the server, which is
checked by urllib3.

Normally, urllib3 takes care of setting and checking these values for you when
you connect to a host by name. However, it's sometimes useful to set a
connection's expected Host header and certificate hostname (subject),
especially when you are connecting without using name resolution. For example,
you could connect to a server by IP using HTTPS like so:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    pool = urllib3.HTTPSConnectionPool(
        "104.154.89.105",
        server_hostname="badssl.com"
    )
    pool.request(
        "GET",
        "/",
        headers={"Host": "badssl.com"},
        assert_same_host=False
    )


Note that when you use a connection in this way, you must specify
``assert_same_host=False``.

This is useful when DNS resolution for ``example.org`` does not match the
address that you would like to use. The IP may be for a private interface, or
you may want to use a specific host under round-robin DNS.


.. _assert_hostname:

Verifying TLS against a different host
--------------------------------------

If the server you're connecting to presents a different certificate than the
hostname or the SNI hostname, you can use ``assert_hostname``:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    pool = urllib3.HTTPSConnectionPool(
        "wrong.host.badssl.com",
        assert_hostname="badssl.com",
    )
    pool.request("GET", "/")


.. _ssl_client:

Client Certificates
-------------------

You can also specify a client certificate. This is useful when both the server
and the client need to verify each other's identity. Typically these
certificates are issued from the same authority. To use a client certificate,
provide the full path when creating a :class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager`:

.. code-block:: python

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(
        cert_file="/path/to/your/client_cert.pem",
        cert_reqs="CERT_REQUIRED",
        ca_certs="/path/to/your/certificate_bundle"
    )

If you have an encrypted client certificate private key you can use
the ``key_password`` parameter to specify a password to decrypt the key.

.. code-block:: python

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(
        cert_file="/path/to/your/client_cert.pem",
        cert_reqs="CERT_REQUIRED",
        key_file="/path/to/your/client.key",
        key_password="keyfile_password"
    )

If your key isn't encrypted the ``key_password`` parameter isn't required.

TLS minimum and maximum versions
--------------------------------

When the configured TLS versions by urllib3 aren't compatible with the TLS versions that
the server is willing to use you'll likely see an error like this one:

.. code-block::

    SSLError(1, '[SSL: UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL] unsupported protocol (_ssl.c:1124)')

Starting in v2.0 by default urllib3 uses TLS 1.2 and later so servers that only support TLS 1.1
or earlier will not work by default with urllib3.

To fix the issue you'll need to use the ``ssl_minimum_version`` option along with the `TLSVersion enum`_
in the standard library ``ssl`` module to configure urllib3 to accept a wider range of TLS versions.

For the best security it's a good idea to set this value to the version of TLS that's being used by the
server. For example if the server requires TLS 1.0 you'd configure urllib3 like so:

.. code-block:: python
    
    import ssl
    import urllib3
    
    http = urllib3.PoolManager(
        ssl_minimum_version=ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1
    )
    # This request works!
    resp = http.request("GET", "https://tls-v1-0.badssl.com:1010")

.. _TLSVersion enum: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.TLSVersion

.. _ssl_mac:
.. _certificate_validation_and_mac_os_x:

Certificate Validation and macOS
--------------------------------

Apple-provided Python and OpenSSL libraries contain a patches that make them
automatically check the system keychain's certificates. This can be
surprising if you specify custom certificates and see requests unexpectedly
succeed. For example, if you are specifying your own certificate for validation
and the server presents a different certificate you would expect the connection
to fail. However, if that server presents a certificate that is in the system
keychain then the connection will succeed.

`This article <https://hynek.me/articles/apple-openssl-verification-surprises/>`_
has more in-depth analysis and explanation.

.. _ssl_warnings:

TLS Warnings
------------

urllib3 will issue several different warnings based on the level of certificate
verification support. These warnings indicate particular situations and can
be resolved in different ways.

* :class:`~exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning`
    This happens when a request is made to an HTTPS URL without certificate
    verification enabled. Follow the :ref:`certificate verification <ssl>`
    guide to resolve this warning.

.. _disable_ssl_warnings:

Making unverified HTTPS requests is **strongly** discouraged, however, if you
understand the risks and wish to disable these warnings, you can use :func:`~urllib3.disable_warnings`:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3
    
    urllib3.disable_warnings()

Alternatively you can capture the warnings with the standard :mod:`logging` module:

.. code-block:: python

    logging.captureWarnings(True)

Finally, you can suppress the warnings at the interpreter level by setting the
``PYTHONWARNINGS`` environment variable or by using the
`-W flag <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-w>`_.

Brotli Encoding
---------------

Brotli is a compression algorithm created by Google with better compression
than gzip and deflate and is supported by urllib3 if the
`Brotli <https://pypi.org/Brotli>`_ package or
`brotlicffi <https://github.com/python-hyper/brotlicffi>`_ package is installed.
You may also request the package be installed via the ``urllib3[brotli]`` extra:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install urllib3[brotli]

Here's an example using brotli encoding via the ``Accept-Encoding`` header:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    urllib3.request(
        "GET",
        "https://www.google.com/",
        headers={"Accept-Encoding": "br"}
    )

Zstandard Encoding
------------------

`Zstandard <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8878>`_
is a compression algorithm created by Facebook with better compression
than brotli, gzip and deflate (see `benchmarks <https://facebook.github.io/zstd/#benchmarks>`_)
and is supported by urllib3 if the `zstandard package <https://pypi.org/project/zstandard/>`_ is installed.
You may also request the package be installed via the ``urllib3[zstd]`` extra:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install urllib3[zstd]

.. note::

    Zstandard support in urllib3 requires using v0.18.0 or later of the ``zstandard`` package.
    If the version installed is less than v0.18.0 then Zstandard support won't be enabled.

Here's an example using zstd encoding via the ``Accept-Encoding`` header:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib3

    urllib3.request(
        "GET",
        "https://www.facebook.com/",
        headers={"Accept-Encoding": "zstd"}
    )


Decrypting Captured TLS Sessions with Wireshark
-----------------------------------------------
Python 3.8 and higher support logging of TLS pre-master secrets.
With these secrets tools like `Wireshark <https://wireshark.org>`_ can decrypt captured
network traffic.

To enable this simply define environment variable `SSLKEYLOGFILE`:

.. code-block:: bash

    export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/path/to/keylogfile.txt

Then configure the key logfile in `Wireshark <https://wireshark.org>`_, see
`Wireshark TLS Decryption <https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS#TLS_Decryption>`_ for instructions.

Custom SSL Contexts
-------------------

You can exercise fine-grained control over the urllib3 SSL configuration by
providing a :class:`ssl.SSLContext <python:ssl.SSLContext>` object. For purposes
of compatibility, we recommend you obtain one from
:func:`~urllib3.util.create_urllib3_context`.

Once you have a context object, you can mutate it to achieve whatever effect
you'd like. For example, the code below loads the default SSL certificates, sets
the :data:`ssl.OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT<python:ssl.OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT>`
flag that isn't set by default, and then makes a HTTPS request:

.. code-block:: python

    import ssl

    from urllib3 import PoolManager
    from urllib3.util import create_urllib3_context

    ctx = create_urllib3_context()
    ctx.load_default_certs()
    ctx.options |= ssl.OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT

    with PoolManager(ssl_context=ctx) as pool:
        pool.request("GET", "https://www.google.com/")

Note that this is different from passing an ``options`` argument to
:func:`~urllib3.util.create_urllib3_context` because we don't overwrite
the default options: we only add a new one.
