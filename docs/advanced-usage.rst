.. currentmodule:: urllib3


Customizing pool behavior
-------------------------

The :class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager` class automatically handles creating
:class:`~connectionpool.ConnectionPool` instances for each host as needed. By
default, it will keep a maximum of 10 :class:`~connectionpool.ConnectionPool`
instances. If you're making requests to many different hosts it might improve
performance to increase this number::

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager(num_pools=50)

However, keep in mind that this does increase memory and socket consumption.

Similarly, the :class:`~connectionpool.ConnectionPool` class keeps a pool
of individual :class:`~connection.HTTPConnection` instances. These connections
are used during an individual request and returned to the pool when the request
is complete. By default only one connection will be saved for re-use. If you
are making many requests to the same host simultaneously it might improve
performance to increase this number::

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager(maxsize=10)
    # Alternatively
    >>> http = urllib3.HTTPConnectionPool('google.com', maxsize=10)

The behavior of the pooling for :class:`~connectionpool.ConnectionPool` is
different from :class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager`. By default, if a new
request is made and there is no free connection in the pool then a new
connection will be created. However, this connection will not be saved if more
than ``maxsize`` connections exist. This means that ``maxsize`` does not
determine the maximum number of connections that can be open to a particular
host, just the maximum number of connections to keep in the pool. However, if you specify ``block=True`` then there can be at most ``maxsize`` connections
open to a particular host::

    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager(maxsize=10, block=True)
    # Alternatively
    >>> http = urllib3.HTTPConnectionPool('google.com', maxsize=10, block=True)

Any new requests will block until a connection is available from the pool.
This is a great way to prevent flooding a host with too many connections in
multi-threaded applications.

.. _stream:

Streaming and IO
----------------

When dealing with large responses it's often better to stream the response
content::

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager()
    >>> r = http.request(
    ...     'GET',
    ...     'http://httpbin.org/bytes/1024',
    ...     preload_content=False)
    >>> for chunk in r.stream(32):
    ...     print(chunk)
    b'...'
    b'...'
    ...
    >>> r.release_conn()

Setting ``preload_content`` to ``False`` means that urllib3 will stream the
response content. :meth:`~response.HTTPResponse.stream` lets you iterate over
chunks of the response content.

.. note:: When using ``preload_content=False``, you should call 
    :meth:`~response.HTTPResponse.release_conn` to release the http connection
    back to the connection pool so that it can be re-used.

However, you can also treat the :class:`~response.HTTPResponse` instance as
a file-like object. This allows you to do buffering::

    >>> r = http.request(
    ...     'GET',
    ...     'http://httpbin.org/bytes/1024',
    ...     preload_content=False)
    >>> r.read(4)
    b'\x88\x1f\x8b\xe5'

Calls to :meth:`~response.HTTPResponse.read()` will block until more response
data is available. 

    >>> import io
    >>> reader = io.BufferedReader(r, 8)
    >>> reader.read(4)
    >>> r.release_conn()

You can use this file-like object to do things like decode the content using
:mod:`codecs`::

    >>> import codecs
    >>> reader = codecs.getreader('utf-8')
    >>> r = http.request(
    ...     'GET',
    ...     'http://httpbin.org/ip',
    ...     preload_content=False)
    >>> json.load(reader(r))
    {'origin': '127.0.0.1'}
    >>> r.release_conn()

.. _proxies:

Proxies
-------

You can use :class:`~poolmanager.ProxyManager` to tunnel requests through an
HTTP proxy::

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> proxy = urllib3.ProxyManager('http://localhost:3128/')
    >>> proxy.request('GET', 'http://google.com/')

The usage of :class:`~poolmanager.ProxyManager` is the same as
:class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager`.

You can use :class:`~contrib.socks.SOCKSProxyManager` to connect to SOCKS4 or
SOCKS5 proxies. In order to use SOCKS proxies you will need to install
`PySocks <https://pypi.org/project/PySocks/>`_ or install urllib3 with the
``socks`` extra::

    pip install urllib3[socks]

Once PySocks is installed, you can use
:class:`~contrib.socks.SOCKSProxyManager`::

    >>> from urllib3.contrib.socks import SOCKSProxyManager
    >>> proxy = SOCKSProxyManager('socks5://localhost:8889/')
    >>> proxy.request('GET', 'http://google.com/')


.. _ssl_custom:

Custom SSL certificates and client certificates
-----------------------------------------------

Instead of using `certifi <https://certifi.io/>`_ you can provide your
own certificate authority bundle. This is useful for cases where you've
generated your own certificates or when you're using a private certificate
authority. Just provide the full path to the certificate bundle when creating a
:class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager`::

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager(
    ...     cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED',
    ...     ca_certs='/path/to/your/certificate_bundle')

When you specify your own certificate bundle only requests that can be
verified with that bundle will succeed. It's recommended to use a separate
:class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager` to make requests to URLs that do not need
the custom certificate.

You can also specify a client certificate. This is useful when both the server
and the client need to verify each other's identity. Typically these
certificates are issued from the same authority. To use a client certificate,
provide the full path when creating a :class:`~poolmanager.PoolManager`::

    >>> http = urllib3.PoolManager(
    ...     cert_file='/path/to/your/client_cert.pem',
    ...     cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED',
    ...     ca_certs='/path/to/your/certificate_bundle')

.. _ssl_mac:

Certificate validation and Mac OS X
-----------------------------------

Apple-provided Python and OpenSSL libraries contain a patches that make them
automatically check the system keychain's certificates. This can be
surprising if you specify custom certificates and see requests unexpectedly
succeed. For example, if you are specifying your own certificate for validation
and the server presents a different certificate you would expect the connection
to fail. However, if that server presents a certificate that is in the system
keychain then the connection will succeed.

`This article <https://hynek.me/articles/apple-openssl-verification-surprises/>`_
has more in-depth analysis and explanation.

.. _ssl_warnings:

SSL Warnings
------------

urllib3 will issue several different warnings based on the level of certificate
verification support. These warning indicate particular situations and can
be resolved in different ways.

* :class:`~exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning`
    This happens when a request is made to an HTTPS URL without certificate
    verification enabled. Follow the :ref:`certificate verification <ssl>`
    guide to resolve this warning.
* :class:`~exceptions.InsecurePlatformWarning`
    This happens on Python 2 platforms that have an outdated :mod:`ssl` module.
    These older :mod:`ssl` modules can cause some insecure requests to succeed
    where they should fail and secure requests to fail where they should
    succeed. Follow the :ref:`pyOpenSSL <ssl_py2>` guide to resolve this
    warning.

.. _sni_warning:

* :class:`~exceptions.SNIMissingWarning`
    This happens on Python 2 versions older than 2.7.9. These older versions
    lack `SNI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication>`_ support.
    This can cause servers to present a certificate that the client thinks is
    invalid. Follow the :ref:`pyOpenSSL <ssl_py2>` guide to resolve this
    warning.

.. _disable_ssl_warnings:

Making unverified HTTPS requests is **strongly** discouraged, however, if you
understand the risks and wish to disable these warnings, you can use :func:`~urllib3.disable_warnings`::

    >>> import urllib3
    >>> urllib3.disable_warnings()

Alternatively you can capture the warnings with the standard :mod:`logging` module::

    >>> logging.captureWarnings(True)

Finally, you can suppress the warnings at the interpreter level by setting the
``PYTHONWARNINGS`` environment variable or by using the
`-W flag <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-w>`_.

Google App Engine
-----------------

urllib3 supports `Google App Engine <https://cloud.google.com/appengine>`_ with
some caveats.

If you're using the `Flexible environment
<https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/>`_, you do not have to do
any configuration- urllib3 will just work. However, if you're using the
`Standard environment <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/>`_ then
you either have to use :mod:`urllib3.contrib.appengine`'s
:class:`~urllib3.contrib.appengine.AppEngineManager` or use the `Sockets API
<https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sockets/>`_

To use :class:`~urllib3.contrib.appengine.AppEngineManager`::

    >>> from urllib3.contrib.appengine import AppEngineManager
    >>> http = AppEngineManager()
    >>> http.request('GET', 'https://google.com/')

To use the Sockets API, add the following to your app.yaml and use
:class:`~urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager` as usual::

    env_variables:
        GAE_USE_SOCKETS_HTTPLIB : 'true'

For more details on the limitations and gotchas, see
:mod:`urllib3.contrib.appengine`.
